A medium to learn and experience in depth concepts of the development of a game engine. 
This project is, at least for now, heavily inspired on the vulkan tutorial: 
[vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) and youtube vulkan series:[Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9U9IE0gVHA&list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR&pp=iAQB).
Future plans include: 
- refactoring.
- use of cmake or other build tool.
- full comment descriptions, updated links, resources to flatten the learning curve of new vulkan enthusiasts.
- A complete small game engine with all modern functionalities and easy to use GUI (hopefully).
